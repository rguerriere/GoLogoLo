        <h2>Help</h2>
        
        <p>The @GoLogoLo is a desktop Java application for creating and
            editing @logos. The logo is presented in a canvas and items in the
            logo can be found in a list on the left side. These componenets moved up or down or removed altogether.        </p>
        
        <h3>Step 1: Create new logo or load current work.</h3>
        
        <p>To start, run the application and select Create new Logo or select a project from the left side that you have already worked on.<br /><br /></p>
        
        <h3>Step 2: Design</h3>
        
        <p>Click on whatever <strong><em>functionality</em></strong> you would like to implement in  your logo. Whether it be adding a new shape, adding text, changing colors, etc.<br /><br />
        </p>
        
        <h3>Step 3: Save your logo</h3>
        
        <p>Once you've completed your work, you can press the save button and 
            give your file a name, which does not necessarily have to be the same
            as the name you specified in the name text field. Note that the name
            in the app text field will be the name used in the Recent Work list
            of the Welcome dialog.<br /><br /></p>
        
        <h3>Step 4: Export your Logo</h3>
        
        <p>Press the Export button when you wish to export your logo to 
            a image file.</p>
